# PHPractice
I write a lot of PHP at work, the bulk of it being bugfixes and feature
adds for large enterprise clients running sites on WordPress. Because
so much of it is maintenance work, it's been a significant amount of
time since I've built a site from scratch and, because all of it is
WordPress, it's been even longer since I've built anything from scratch
in PHP.

[Programming katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) are
hugely important. They get us back to the basics, remind us of the skills
we have, and the skills we may lose over time if we don't work to retain
them. This project serves as a place to work on my skills, practicing
things like object-oriented programming, coding architecture, dependency
injection, database queries, routing, templating, and more. The end goal
isn't so much a useful web-app, but rather, to have some place that I can
go to work on reinforcing the skills I know, exploring new technologies
and practices in PHP, and eventually branching out to other platforms
beyond WordPress.
